NAME
    Data::Constraint - Trying to bring definitional succintness to Perl

SYNOPSIS
    if (nonzero $value) { ; }
    if (zero $value) { ; }
    if (nonzero(map { $PAGEMODE eq $_ } ('CONFIRM_OFFER', 'VIEW_DETAILS',
    'Purchase Item', 'Confirm Counter Offer')) { handle_these_pagemodes() }

    Possibly more time-consuming, but certainly more succint!
